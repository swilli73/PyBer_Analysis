# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of PyBer Analysis

#### This new analysis was performed for two different purposes. One was to create a DataFrame summarizing and displaying the total rides taken, total driver count, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver for PyBer ride data provided for a region with three different city types (Rural, Suburban, and Urban). The other was to create a readable multiple-line plot from the same original data set that compares total ride fares per city type (Rural, Suburban, and Urban once again) from January 1st, 2019 to April 28th, 2019.

## Results

The results from the summary DataFrame have a few notable differences per city type. Arranged in ascending order, it shows a direct relationship between ride volume and individual ride cost. While urban areas generate more profits due to a higher amount of trips taken, the average cost of the rides is a lot less than in suburban and rural areas. 

Far less rides were taken in rural areas, but each of those rides were significantly more expensive (especially from a consumer's point of view) than a trip that would've been taken in an urban area. The data for the suburbs shows a solid middle ground that allows the stark difference between rural and urban areas to be more easily viewed and compared.

It can be inferred that due to terrain + lifestyle/commute differences between different types of cities, rides are more expensive in rural areas due to longer trips usually being taken to get from one area to another (as things are more spaced apart). Inversely, urban areashave a higher volume of buildings that are positioned closer together and it can be inferred that trips are shorter and therefore less expensive due to this. 

#### **However**, it should be noted that there is no data provided on ride duration or ride distance to concretely back this up.

The results from the multiple-line plot illustrate the total fares by city type between January 1st, 2019 to April 28, 2019. It backs up the summary DataFrame in visually showing how urban areas generated the highest total fare, followed by suburban areas, and then rural areas. 

It also shows how fare costs varied week by week, with some weeks performing better than others. Most notably is about the 3rd week of February, where each city type experienced a relevant spike in total fare costs. However, neither city type ever has a time where they're close enough to share similar fare costs and remain separated.

## Summary

#### There are three business recommendations I could give based on this data to address the disparities among the city types. 

- Look into expanding business into the suburbs and rural areas as they grow and develop at a much faster rate, which will allow them to catch up more with the performance of urban areas as the population goes up and road/highway infrastructure is improved. 

- Supplement the collection of data on ride duration/ride distance so the correlation between that and the fare costs of each city type. This will allow for direct, visible comparison the two metrics. 

- Push for more advertising campaigns around busier times of the year, such as what is visible on the line plot. It seems like rural and urban areas experience more peaks from around the 3rd week of February to the beginning of the 1st week of April, for example.
